# Notes
### What's in this repository?
 have collected all of the detailed notes I wrote during my studies at HebrewU as well as courses I studied independently, and published them as a part of my goal to make Data Science & Quantitative trade topics more accessible to Hebrew speakers.</br>
This collection contains detailed notes in Hebrew on subjects such as Math (Calculus, Linear Algebra, Probability, Discrete Math)</br>
and Advanced Statistical Methods(GLM, Computational Methods in Nonlinear Optimization, Information theory, Nonparametric statistics)</br>
Foundations of Computer Science (Data Structures, Algorithms, Complexity), as well as advanced Data Science (Machine Learning,).</br>
My goal is to make data science and statistics more accessible to Hebrew speakers.</br>
All my notes are from my Bsc in Mathmateics&Stastics and from my MSc in Stastics&Data-Science.</br> 
Each note is available as a PDF file.</br>
Those files are filed into 3 fields for easy navigation, and their names contain the year they were written in.</br>
